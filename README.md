# Capstone-Project

Tentative Stages:
1.	Read all the datasets and create csv files for them so that they are easily readable and loadable for me. I am working with the Reviews dataset and the Businesses dataset from Yelp. 
2.	Descriptive statistics for both datasets. 
3.	Merge the datasets into one file so that now I can see the reviews for each business joined. 
4.	I want to be able to do word counts and find most frequently used words relative to high ratings vs low ratings. This is essentially text classification. 
5.	Then I want to be able to conduct sentiment analysis. Which words are positive, which are negative. Associate them. 
6.	Also I want to be able to find the most common words that are associated with positive reviews and negative reviews for restaurants, that are not just basic pos/neg words, such as “great” or “bad”. I want to be able to see what else can help add to a positive/negative review? Such as Positive: ambience or price, and Negative: service or price. 
7.	Once I have these two issues figured out, I want to conduct a test set where I can predict which words will determine positive reviews, which will determine negative reviews.
